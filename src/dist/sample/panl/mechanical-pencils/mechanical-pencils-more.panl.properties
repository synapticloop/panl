#     - facet parameters - used to refine/narrow the search query term        #
#     - SOLR configuration - used to change how the results are displayed     #
#         for example:                                                        #

# The following are considered metadata that changes what results are returned
# and in what format.  These are not considered facets, however they
# __DO_NOT__ conform to the panl.lpse.length property above and are __ALWAYS__
# a constant length of 1 (one).  These define the following metadata:
#
#    panl.param.query - The query that is sent through to the Solr server
#    panl.param.sort - The sort order
#    panl.param.page - The page number
#    panl.param.numrows - The number of results per page by default
#    panl.param.query.operand - The Solr query operand (q.op)
#    panl.param.passthrough - Pass through parameters which will not be passed
#         through to the Solr search server (see property below)
#    panl.param.passthrough.canonical - Whether to keep this URI path value in
#         the generated canonical URI (and all URIs generated)  If not included
#         this property defaults to false
#
# NOTE: The LPSE codes assigned to the metadata __MUST_NOT__ be the same as any
#       of the facets, __OR__ start with the same letter as any of the facets
#       if the panl.lpse.length is greater than 1
#
# NOTE: Both the page and numrows parameters may have a prefix and suffix
#       assigned to them, for example:

# return the same set of results, just with a longer LPSE URI.  You may wish to
# include these results for a more verbose URL and possibly better search

# Facets that include the same number of results as the number of found
# documents will not be included by default.  The reasoning behind this is that
# if, by using this facet, you will get exactly the same results, then this is
# not a refinement of the query at all, it will simply return the same set of
# results, just with a longer LPSE URI.
#
# The default value for this property is false, so you do not need to include

#                      ----- ---- ----- ----- -------------
# There are two ways to do an MLT query:
#
#   1. MoreLikeThis Query Parser
#      This uses the existing /select query handler, which is already
#      configured in the solrconfig.xml file, or
#   2. MoreLikeThis Request Handler
#      This will require a solr.MoreLikeThisHandler - to be registered in the
#      solrconfig.xml file.
#
#                            MoreLikeThis Query Parser
#                            ============ ===== ======
#    Use this query parser if your Solr server is set up in cloud mode __AND__
#    there are more than one replica (the number of shards do not matter).
#
#    Set the properties:
#        panl.mlt.enable=true
#        panl.mlt.handler=/select
#        panl.mlt.type=select

#                          MoreLikeThis Request Handler
#                          ============ ======= =======
#    Use this query parser if your Solr server is not setup in cloud mode, and
#    you wish to have a separate handler for the MLT.  Note that this handler
#    is not cloud aware will only return nodes from the first replica.  Due to
#    this Panl will attempt to retry the query against other nodes if no valid
#    response was received.  This may still fail...
#
#    Set the properties:
#        panl.mlt.enable=true
#        panl.mlt.handler=/mlt
#        panl.mlt.type=mlt
#        panl.mlt.numretries=6
#
#   You will also need to add configuration to the solrconfig.xml file for this
#   to work:
#
#     <requestHandler name="/mlt" class="solr.MoreLikeThisHandler">
#       <str name="mlt.fl">body</str>
#     </requestHandler>
#
#                            ~ ~ ~ IMPORTANT ~ ~ ~
#
#          If in doubt use the MoreLikeThis Query Parser (i.e. /select)
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
# By default this functionality is DISABLED with the panl.mlt.enable property
# set to false if missing or not set to exactly "true".
#
# The properties are as follows:
#
#    panl.mlt.enable - Whether the MLT functionality is enabled in Panl for
#        this CaFUP (type: Boolean, default: false)
#    panl.mlt.handler - The handler path for the Solr MLT request handler
#        (type: String, default: /select)
#    panl.mlt.type - The type of the handler the Solr MLT request handler, must
#        be one of 'select' or 'mlt' (without the quotes)
#        (type: String, default: select)
#    panl.mlt.fl - The fields to reference for the MLT lookup (type: comma
#        separated Strings, default: N/A)
#
#                            ~ ~ ~ IMPORTANT ~ ~ ~
#
#   - If you have not enabled the MLT functionality in Solr, then this will
#     not work in the Panl server
#   - The panl.mlt.handler property MUST match the configured handler in the
#     Solr configuration
#   - The fields listed in the panl.mlt.fl MUST exist in the Solr collection

#        the maximum document frequency using a ratio relative to the number of
#        documents in the index. The value provided must be an integer between
#        0 and 100. For example, mlt.maxdfpct=75 means the word will be ignored

#        without the single quotes).  The default is 'none' if missing or not
#        configured.
#    panl.mlt.match.include=<Boolean> (default: true) - Specifies if the
#        response should include the matched document. If set to false, the
#        response will look like a normal select response.
#    panl.mlt.match.offset=<Integer> (default: none) - Specifies an offset into

#       <code> is the LPSE code and __MUST__ be the same length as the
#              panl.lpse.length
# <solr_field> is the solr field name which __MUST__ map to the Solr field
#              name in the solr schema.xml configuration file
# <field_name> is the name of the facet in a more human friendly version, will
#              be returned with the results, and may be used as the facet
#              header
#
# An additional property can be set
#     panl.uniquekey.<code>=<Boolean>
#
# Which configures the field to be the Solr unique key for the Solr indexed
# collection (as defined by the <uniqueKey /> XML element in the Solr managed
# schema file.
#
# This is used with the More Like This handler and there can be __ONE__ and
# __ONLY_ONE__ defined per file.  Additionally, this property __MUST__ be set
# if the More Like This handler is to be used.
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
# IMPORTANT: There are a plethora of properties that may be set, depending on
#            the defined Solr field type and the behaviour of the field that
#            You would like the Panl server to exhibit.  There are different
#            types of facets, some of which have specific configuration
#            properties that can be set.
#
#             - Regular facet
#             - BOOLEAN facet
#             - OR facet
#             - RANGE facet
#             - DATE facet
#
#            Where possible, all properties that are available for a specific
#            field will be included, but commented out.  This does increase the
#            number of lines in the file, however it makes a good reference
#            point.
#
#            For additional information on any of the above facets and
#            properties, please see the documentation.
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
# Additionally (and optionally), you may define a prefix and/or a suffix for
# any defined facet.  This will make the URL longer, but will also make it more
# human understandable. Panl will automatically remove these before sending the
# query to the Solr server
#
# The format is:
#     panl.prefix.<code>=<prefix>
#     panl.suffix.<code>=<suffix>
#
# where:
#       <code> is the LPSE code and __MUST__ be the same length as the
#              panl.lpse.length
#     <prefix> is the text that will be prefixed before the selected facet in
#              the URI
#     <suffix> is the text that will be suffixed after the selected facet in
#              the URI
#
# As an example, should you have a manufacturer facet (LPSE code 'm') value of
# 'ACME Incorporated' with the following properties set:
#
#     panl.prefix.m=Manufactured by
#     panl.suffix.m=\ // a fine company
#
# The non-suffixed, non-prefixed URI encoding would be:
#     /ACME Incorporated/m/
#
# Post processing (i.e. URL decoding), the URI would be the following:
#     /Manufactured by ACME Incorporated // a fine company/m/
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
# Should you wish to return an additional fixed JSON object to both the active
# and available facets, then you may define a property for an facet with the
# format:
#
#     panl.extra.<code>=<valid_json_object>
#
# where:
#                  <code> is the LPSE code and __MUST__ be the same length as
#                         the panl.lpse.length
#     <valid_json_object> is any arbitrary (and valid) JSON object in string
#                         format, e.g.:
#                           { "valid": "JSON", "object": true }
#
# This 'extra' JSON object will be added to the defined facet in the available
# and active facets objects under the JSON key 'extra'.
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
# For RANGE facets the following properties are available, these options work
# best with Integer or Floating point types for Solr Fields.  It is available
# for String Solr dataTypes, although if there is is anything more than just a
# single character then the front-end implementation becomes more difficult.

# the solr managed-schema.xml file and will almost certainly not be the order
# in which you would want to generate the URLs.
#
# NOTE: all defined panl facet fields must be represented here, and the
# recommendation is to have the properties in the following order:
#
#     panl.param.passthrough
#
#   ... all the other LPSE codes ...
#
#     panl.param.query
#     panl.param.page
#     panl.param.numrows

#     panl.param.query.operand

# Of course, you are welcome to change this.

#                        Panl Facet Order Configuration
#                        ---- ----- ----- -------------
# This is the order in which the facets will be returned in the Panl JSON
# response.  This differs from the above property, which controls the order of
# facets values in the URL.
#
# NOTE: The panl.param.* LPSE codes are not included in the following list, if
#       any of the defined facets are not included in the list, then they will
#       automatically be appended to the order.
#
# This will be returned in the Panl JSON response object with the key:
#
#     panl.facetorder
#
# As a JSON Array of objects in the form:
#     [
#       {
#         "type": "<type>",
#         "panl_code": "<panl_code>",
#         "facet_name": "<facet_name>"
#       },
#
#       ...
#
#     ]
#
# where:
#       <type> is the type of the facet and maps to the available JSON key,
#              which will be one of:
#                - facets
#                - range_facets
#                - data_range_facets
#  <panl_code> is the bound LPSE code which can be used as a lookup
#              name in the solr schema.xml configuration file
# <facet_name> is the solr field name which can be used as a lookup

#                       Panl LPSE Ignore Configuration
#                       ---- ---- ------ -------------
# Any LPSE code listed below will be ignored and not returned in either the
# active or available filters JSON object
#
# This is useful when you want to use a facet for a lookup, but not allow the
# facet to be removed or returned in the list of available or active facets. An
# example usage would be when generating a link to a single results (say with
# its id field) and the returned available facets would return all of the ids
# as facets.

# Below are the fields that are configured to be returned for the query, these
# fields are added to the query and must match the solr fields.
#
# By default, the panl.results.fields.default always exists - even if it is not
# included in these properties file - it is included here for reference for all
# the fields that are stored by the solr engine.  If the default fieldset is
# not explicitly defined, then it will request that __ALL__ fields be sent back
# from the Solr server.  If you edit the default fieldset, then only those
# fields referenced will be sent back.
#
# Additionally, there is a hidden fieldset panl.results.fields.empty which will
# __ALWAYS__ exist and __ALWAYS__ return no fields in the document.  (This is
# done by requesting no documents be returned with the results, irrespective of
# the passed in parameters and default rows parameter.)  If you define a
# fieldset as empty, then it will log an error on startup and be silently
# ignored
#
# To define a fieldset, as an example, another property:
#
#     panl.results.fields.firstfive
#
# was also automatically generated with only the first five fields.  You may
# rename, delete or add any of the results fields properties as you wish.
