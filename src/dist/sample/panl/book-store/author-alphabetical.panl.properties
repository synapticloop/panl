# The following configuration values determine how the LPSE is configured.    #
# The LPSE is made up of the following types:                                 #
#     - query term parameter - the actual query entered by the user of the    #
#         site                                                                #
#     - facet parameters - used to refine/narrow the search query term        #
#     - SOLR configuration - used to change how the results are displayed     #
#         for example:                                                        #

# The following are considered metadata that changes what results are returned
# and in what format.  These are not considered facets, however they
# __DO_NOT__ conform to the panl.lpse.length property above and are __ALWAYS__
# a constant length of 1 (one).  These define the following metadata:
#
#    panl.param.query - The query that is sent through to the Solr server
#    panl.param.sort - The sort order
#    panl.param.page - The page number
#    panl.param.numrows - The number of results per page by default
#    panl.param.query.operand - The Solr query operand (q.op)
#    panl.param.passthrough - Pass through parameters which will not be passed
#         through to the Solr search server (see property below)
#    panl.param.passthrough.canonical - Whether to keep this URI path value in
#         the generated canonical URI (and all URIs generated)  If not included
#         this property defaults to false
#
# NOTE: The LPSE codes assigned to the metadata __MUST_NOT__ be the same as any
#       of the facets, __OR__ start with the same letter as any of the facets
#       if the panl.lpse.length is greater than 1
#
# NOTE: Both the page and numrows parameters may have a prefix and suffix
#       assigned to them, for example:
#
#    panl.param.page.prefix=page-
#    panl.param.page.suffix=
#
#    panl.param.numrows=n
#    panl.param.numrows.prefix=

#                     Whether to include single facets
#                     ------- -- ------- ------ ------
# Facets that only include a single result to further refine the query will not
# be included by default.  The reasoning behind this is that having a list of
# facets with only one result will not refine the query at all, it will simply
# return the same set of results, just with a longer LPSE URI.  You may wish to
# include these results for a more verbose URL and possibly better search
# engine visibility
#
# The default value for this property is false, so you do not need to include
# it unless you wish to enable this feature, i.e.
#
#     panl.include.single.facets=true
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~

#                    Whether to include same number facets
#                    ------- -- ------- ---- ------ ------
# Facets that include the same number of results as the number of found
# documents will not be included by default.  The reasoning behind this is that
# if, by using this facet, you will get exactly the same results, then this is
# not a refinement of the query at all, it will simply return the same set of
# results, just with a longer LPSE URI.
#
# The default value for this property is false, so you do not need to include
# it unless you wish to enable this feature, i.e.

# This maps to the Solr q.op parameter, by default it is OR (the '-') character

#
# This value can also be changed per request with the LPSE encoded parameter

#                        The Minimum Facet Value Count

# If the query would return a facet with a count value less than this amount,
# then it will not be returned.
#
# The reasoning for this, is that if you were to choose this facet, the results
# are guaranteed to return zero rows - therefore useless.
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
# IMPORTANT: If you have a 'facet OR' enabled for one or more of the facet
#            fields, then you __MUST__ set this to 0 (zero) to ensure that the
#            correct facets are returned.

#               The Default Number of Rows (Documents) To Return
#               --- ------- ------ -- ---- ----------- -- ------
# The Solr default is 10 documents to be returned, however, this may be set to
# any positive integer value.
#
# This value can also be changed by the end user with the LPSE encoded
# parameter see the property for the LPSE code that this is bound to:

# the included sample configuration files.
#
# The default for this is true, i.e.

#                             ---- ----- -------------
# The panl facets that are in use by this collection.  The format is:
#     panl.facet.<code>=<solr_field>
#     panl.name.<code>=<field_name>
#
# where:
#       <code> is the LPSE code and __MUST__ be the same length as the
#              panl.lpse.length
# <solr_field> is the solr field name which __MUST__ map to the Solr field
#              name in the solr schema.xml configuration file
# <field_name> is the name of the facet in a more human friendly version, will
#              be returned with the results, and may be used as the facet
#              header
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
# IMPORTANT: There are a plethora of properties that may be set, depending on
#            the defined Solr field type and the behaviour of the field that
#            You would like the Panl server to exhibit.  There are different
#            types of facets, some of which have specific configuration
#            properties that can be set.
#
#             - Regular facet
#             - BOOLEAN facet
#             - OR facet
#             - RANGE facet
#             - DATE facet
#
#            Where possible, all properties that are available for a specific
#            field will be included, but commented out.  This does increase the
#            number of lines in the file, however it makes a good reference
#            point.
#
#            For additional information on any of the above facets and
#            properties, please see the documentation.
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
# Additionally (and optionally), you may define a prefix and/or a suffix for
# any defined facet.  This will make the URL longer, but will also make it more
# human understandable. Panl will automatically remove these before sending the
# query to the Solr server
#
# The format is:
#     panl.prefix.<code>=<prefix>
#     panl.suffix.<code>=<suffix>
#
# where:
#       <code> is the LPSE code and __MUST__ be the same length as the
#              panl.lpse.length
#     <prefix> is the text that will be prefixed before the selected facet in
#              the URI
#     <suffix> is the text that will be suffixed after the selected facet in
#              the URI
#
# As an example, should you have a manufacturer facet (LPSE code 'm') value of
# 'ACME Incorporated' with the following properties set:
#
#     panl.prefix.m=Manufactured by
#     panl.suffix.m=\ // a fine company
#
# The non-suffixed, non-prefixed URI encoding would be:
#     /ACME Incorporated/m/
#
# Post processing (i.e. URL decoding), the URI would be the following:
#     /Manufactured by ACME Incorporated // a fine company/m/
#

# NOTE: If this file was generated by the Panl generator, then a comment is
#       included before each of the lpse fields with the XML definition from

#
# NOTE: ONLY fields that are INDEXED and STORED are included in the lpse fields
#       as they are the only ones that will have faceting enabled on them.
#
# NOTE: You do not need to define to facet on all the fields - any definitions
#       of fields that you do not wish to facet on may be simply deleted (it
#       is recommended to comment out the fields so that they may be easily

#                        Panl LPSE Order Configuration
#                        ---- ---- ----- -------------
# This is the order in which the URL will be generated, the default order
# generated by panl generate is the order in which the fields were defined in
# the solr managed-schema.xml file and will almost certainly not be the order
# in which you would want to generate the URLs.
#
# NOTE: all defined panl facet fields must be represented here, and the
# recommendation is to have the properties in the following order:
#
#     panl.param.passthrough
#
#   ... all the other LPSE codes ...
#
#     panl.param.query
#     panl.param.page
#     panl.param.numrows
#     panl.param.sort
#     panl.param.query.operand
#
# Of course, you are welcome to change this.

# Any LPSE code listed below will be ignored and not returned in either the
# active or available filters JSON object
#
# This is useful when you want to use a facet for a lookup, but not allow the
# facet to be removed or returned in the list of available or active facets. An
# example usage would be when generating a link to a single results (say with
# its id field) and the returned available facets would return all of the ids
# as facets.

# By default, the panl.results.fields.default always exists - even if it is not
# included in these properties file - it is included here for reference for all
# the fields that are stored by the solr engine.  If the default fieldset is
# not explicitly defined, then it will request that __ALL__ fields be sent back
# from the Solr server.  If you edit the default fieldset, then only those
# fields referenced will be sent back.
#
# As an example, another property:
#
#     panl.results.fields.firstfive
#
# was also automatically generated with only the first five fields.  You may
# rename, delete or add any of the results fields properties as you wish.
