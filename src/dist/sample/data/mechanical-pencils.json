The grip was also subtly different from the current design. It is a shame that they ‘updated’ the body to be plastic. The original Criterium pencil with grip styling — was manufactured by Conté.  Generally, Bic products are well made, if you get one with a proper mechanism, or invest a small amount of time in fixing one that isn’t working, then this is a great entry-level pencil.",
