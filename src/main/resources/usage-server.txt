  [SERVER] To start the Panl server:

    bin\panl \
      server \
      [-properties panl_properties_file_location] \
      [-port port_number]

  [-properties panl_properties_file_location] (optional) the properties file
      to load.  If this property is not included, the file named
      panl.properties in the directory from which the server start command was
      invoked will be searched for and, if found, will be used.  If this file
      cannot be found, then the server will fail to start.

  [-port port_number] (optional) the port number to start the server on.  The
      default port number is 8181.
