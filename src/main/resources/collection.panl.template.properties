#              ---- ---- ------- -------- ------ -------------
#
# It uses (L)ast (P)ath (S)eparator (E)ncoding which will use the URI path and
# convert it to a Solr search query.  An LPSE encoded URI path will be of the
# following format:
#
#   /something/something-else/se/
#
# rather than ?firstfield=something&secondfield=something-else
#
# The following characters may be used in the url for the encoding of the
# facets and queries.
#
#        A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
#        a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
#        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
#
# The following are reserved characters and __MUST__ not be used as they are
# modifiers that the Panl server users
#
#        + - .
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
#   NOTE: The Panl server will not enforce the above two rules.  If either the
#         reserved characters, or a character outside of the allowable encoding
#         characters, then the Panl server may return erroneous, or a 500
#         internal server error.
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
# The following configuration values determine how the LPSE is configured.  The
# LPSE is made up of the following types:
#     - query term parameter - the actual query entered by the user of the site
#     - facet parameters - used to refine/narrow the search query term
#     - SOLR configuration - used to change how the results are displayed - e.g.
#       sort order, number of results per page and page number
#     - facet modifiers - used to modify the way in which facets are utilised
#
# First up, the number of characters that are used for encoding of a particular
# parameter must be set.  This number must then also match all the
#   solr.field.*
#
# definitions, else a FATAL encoding error will occur and the server will not
# be started.  This defaults to a single character if not set - i.e.
#   panl.lpse.num=1

# The following are considered metadata that changes what results are returned
# and in what format.  These are not considered facets, however they do need to
# be the same size as the panl.lpse.num property above.  These define what the

#                     Whether to include single facets
#                     ------- -- ------- ------ ------
# Facets that only include a single result to further refine the query will not
# be included by default.  The reasoning behind this is that having only one
# defined facet does not refine the query at all, it will simply return the
# same set of results, just with a longer LPSE URI
#
# The default value for this property is false, so you do not need to include
# it unless you wish to enable this feature, i.e.

#                    Whether to include same number facets
#                    ------- -- ------- ---- ------ ------
# Facets that include the same number of results as the number of found
# documents will not be included by default.  The reasoning behind this is that
# if by using this facet, you will get exactly the same results, then this is
# not a refinement of the query at all, it will simply return the same set of
# results, just with a longer LPSE URI.
#
# The default value for this property is false, so you do not need to include

#                             Panl Facet Configuration
#                             ---- ----- -------------
#
# The panl facets that are in use by this collection.  The format is:
#   panl.facet.<code>=<solr_field>
#   panl.name.<code>=<field_name>
#
# where:
#       <code> is the LPSE code and __MUST__ be the same length as the
#              panl.lpse.num
# <solr_field> is the solr field name which __MUST__ map to the Solr field
#              name in the configuration file
# <field_name> is the name of the facet in a more human friendly version, will
#              be returned with the results, and may be used as the facet
#              header
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
# Additionally (and optionally), you may define a prefix and/or a suffix for
# any defined facet.  This will make the URL longer, but will also make it more
# human understandable. Panl will automatically remove these before sending the
# query to the Solr server
#
# The format is:
#   panl.prefix.<code>=<prefix>
#   panl.suffix.<code>=<suffix>
#
# where:
#       <code> is the LPSE code and __MUST__ be the same length as the
#              panl.lpse.num
#     <prefix> is the text that will be prefixed before the selected facet in
#              the URI
#     <suffix> is the text that will be suffixed after the selected facet in
#              the URI
#
# As an example, should you have a manufacturer facet (LPSE code 'm') value of
# 'ACME Incorporated' with the following properties set:
#
#   panl.prefix.m=Manufactured by
#   panl.suffix.m= // a fine company
#
# The non-suffixed, non-prefixed URI encoding would be:
#   /ACME Incorporated/m/
#
# Post processing, the URI would be the following:
#   /Manufactured by ACME Incorporated // a fine company/m/
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
# NOTE: A comment is included before each of the lpse fields with the XML that
#       from the schema that it was generated.
#
# NOTE: ONLY fields that are INDEXED and STORED are included in the lpse fields
#       as they are the only ones that will have faceting enabled on them.
#
# NOTE: You do not need to define to facet on all the fields - any definitions
#       of fields that you do not wish to facet on may be simply deleted from
#       this file.
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
# You may return additional fields with a query that are either faceted or not
# and is defined in the
#   panl.results.fields.*
#
# properties towards the bottom of this file

#
# This is the order in which the URL will be generated, the default order
# generated by panl generate is the order in which the fields were defined in
# the solr managed-schema.xml file and will almost certainly not be the order
# in which you would want to generate the URLs.
#
# NOTE: all defined panl facet fields must be represented here, and the
# recommendation is to have the properties in the following order:
#
#   panl.param.passthrough
#
#   ... all the other LPSE codes ...
#
#   panl.param.query
#   panl.param.page
#   panl.param.numrows
#   panl.param.sort
#   panl.param.operand

# Of course, you are welcome to change this.

# By default, the panl.results.fields.all always exists - even if it is not

# the fields that are stored by the solr engine.
#
# As an example, another property:
#   panl.results.fields.firstfive
#
# was also automatically generated with only the first five fields.  You may
# rename, delete or add any of the results fields as you wish (remembering that
# the default 'all' will __ALWAYS__ exist, even if it is not defined in this
