# The LPSE is made up of the following types:                                 #
#     - query term parameter - the actual query entered by the user of the    #

#     - facet parameters - used to refine/narrow the search query term        #
#     - SOLR configuration - used to change how the results are displayed     #
#         for example:                                                        #

# Facets that only include a single result to further refine the query will not

# The default value for this property is false, so you do not need to include

# Facets that include the same number of results as the number of found
# documents will not be included by default.  The reasoning behind this is that
# if, by using this facet, you will get exactly the same results, then this is
# not a refinement of the query at all, it will simply return the same set of

#
# The reasoning for this, is that if you were to choose this facet, the results

#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~

# The panl facets that are in use by this collection.  The format is:
#     panl.facet.<code>=<solr_field>
#     panl.name.<code>=<field_name>
#
# where:
#       <code> is the LPSE code and __MUST__ be the same length as the
#              panl.lpse.length
# <solr_field> is the solr field name which __MUST__ map to the Solr field
#              name in the configuration file
# <field_name> is the name of the facet in a more human friendly version, will
#              be returned with the results, and may be used as the facet
#              header
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
# Additionally (and optionally), you may define a prefix and/or a suffix for
# any defined facet.  This will make the URL longer, but will also make it more
# human understandable. Panl will automatically remove these before sending the
# query to the Solr server
#
# The format is:
#     panl.prefix.<code>=<prefix>
#     panl.suffix.<code>=<suffix>
#
# where:
#       <code> is the LPSE code and __MUST__ be the same length as the
#              panl.lpse.length
#     <prefix> is the text that will be prefixed before the selected facet in
#              the URI
#     <suffix> is the text that will be suffixed after the selected facet in
#              the URI
#
# As an example, should you have a manufacturer facet (LPSE code 'm') value of
# 'ACME Incorporated' with the following properties set:
#
#     panl.prefix.m=Manufactured by
#     panl.suffix.m=\ // a fine company
#
# The non-suffixed, non-prefixed URI encoding would be:
#     /ACME Incorporated/m/
#
# Post processing, the URI would be the following:
#     /Manufactured by ACME Incorporated // a fine company/m/
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
# NOTE: A comment is included before each of the lpse fields with the XML that
#       from the schema that it was generated.
#
# NOTE: ONLY fields that are INDEXED and STORED are included in the lpse fields
#       as they are the only ones that will have faceting enabled on them.
#
# NOTE: You do not need to define to facet on all the fields - any definitions
#       of fields that you do not wish to facet on may be simply deleted from
#       this file.
