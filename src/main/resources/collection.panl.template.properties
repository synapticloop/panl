#              LAST PAGE SEGMENT ENCODING (LPSE) CONFIGURATION
#              ---- ---- ------- -------- ------ -------------
#
# The following configuration values determine how the LPSE is configured.  The
# LPSE is made up of the following types:
#     - query term parameter - the actual query entered by the user of the site
#     - facet parameters - used to refine/narrow the search query term
#     - SOLR configuration - used to change how the results are displayed - e.g.
#       sort order, number of results per page and page number
#     - facet modifiers - used to modify the way in which facets are utilised
#
# First up, the number of characters that are used for encoding of a particular
# parameter must be set.  This number must then also match all the
#   solr.field.*
#
# definitions, else a FATAL encoding error will occur and the server will not
# be started.  This defaults to a single character if not set - i.e.
#   panl.lpse.num=1
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

$panl.lpse.num

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
#
# The following are considered metadata that changes what results are returned
# and in what format.  These are not considered facets, however they do need to
# be the same size as the panl.lpse.num property above.  These define what the
# query parameter will be and __MUST NOT__ be the same as any of the facets
#

#
# the panl facets that are in use by this indexer.  The format is:
#   panl.facet.<code>=<solr_field>
#   panl.name.<code>=<field_name>
#
# where:
#       <code> is the LPSE code and __MUST__ be the same length as the
#              panl.lpse.num
# <solr_field> is the solr field name which __MUST__ map to the Solr field
#              name in the configuration file
# <field_name> is the name of the facet in a more human friendly version, will
#              be returned with the results, and may be used as the facet
#              header
#

#
# NOTE: A comment is included before each of the lpse fields with the XML that
#       from the schema that it was generated.
#
# NOTE: ONLY fields that are INDEXED and STORED are included in the lpse fields
#       as they are the only ones that will have faceting enabled on them.
#
# NOTE: You do not need to define to facet on all the fields - any definitions
#       of fields that you do not wish to facet on may be simply deleted from
#       this file.

#                        Panl LPSE Order Configuration

#
# This is the order in which the URL will be generated, the default order
# generated by panl generate is the order in which the fields were defined in
# the solr managed-schema.xml file and will almost certainly not be the order
# in which you would want to generate the URLs.
#
# NOTE: all defined panl facet fields must be represented here, and the
# recommendation is to have the following properties:
#
#   panl.param.query
#   panl.param.sort
#   panl.param.page
#   panl.param.numrows
#
# As the end of the URL

#
# Below are the fields that are configured to be returned for the query, these
# fields are added to the query and must match the solr fields.
#
# By default, the panl.results.fields.all always exists - even if it is not
# included in these properties file - it is included here for reference for all
# the fields that are stored by the solr engine.
#
# As an example, another property:
#   panl.results.fields.first
#
# was also automatically generated with only the first five fields.  You may
# rename, delete or add any of the results fields as you wish (remembering that
# the default 'all' will __ALWAYS__ exists, even if it is not defined in this
# file).
