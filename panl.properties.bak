# This is the panl configuration file which defines how panl will interact with
# Solr.
#
# It uses (L)ast (P)ath (S)eparator (E)ncoding which will look something like
# the following:
#
#   /something/something-else/se/
#
# rather than ?firstfield=something&secondfield=something-else
#
# The following characters may be used in the url for the encoding of the
# facets and queries.
#
# A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
# a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
# 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
#
# The following are reserved characters and should not be used as they may be
# HTTP encoded - note that the plus ('+') character is still used without
# encoding.

# ! * ' ( ) ; : @ & = + $ , / ? % # [ ]

#                   SOLR SERVER CONNECTION CONFIGURATION
#                   ---- ------ ---------- -------------
#
# need the solr server location
#   solr.search.server.url - the search server URL to connect to which must
#       NOT include the core that it is connecting to - this will be taken
#       care of by the panl request mechanism
#   solr.search.indexer.url - the indexer server URL(s) to connect to
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
# NOTE: What the solr.search.server.url will be will depend on the client that
#       you choose.  The SolrJ client __MUST__ be one of
#
#  - Http2SolrClient
#  - HttpJdkSolrClient
#  - LBHttp2SolrClient
#  - CloudSolrClient
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~
#
# By default - we will be using the CloudSolrClient as it works with the
# example instructions for spinning up a test solr instance
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

#solrj.client=Http2SolrClient

# The panl results viewer url, this is a simple web app which will allow you to
# test the collections, and the URLs that are generated, including field
# inclusion, faceting, querying, and results.
#
# If this property does not exist, or if it is set to false, then no results
# viewer will be available.  You may wish to remove this property for production
# (or perhaps just disallow access to it.)
#
# The URI paths are __ALWAYS__
#    /panl-results-viewer/ - for testing the queries, facets, and results
#    /panl-results-explainer/ - for explaining LPSE encoded URIs and describing
#                               the configuration for the Panl server.

#                           Property File Inclusion
#                           -------- ---- ---------
#
# Each property file defines a singular collection, with the associated
# metadata.
# not strictly necessary, including different files for each of the
# collections that are available for this solr instance should make it less of
# a burden with file editing and confusing around the SOLR facets.
