#                PANL/SOLR SERVER CONNECTION CONFIGURATION                    #
#                --------- ------ ---------- -------------                    #
#                                                                             #
# This is the Panl configuration file which configures the base functionality #
# and defines how Panl will connect to the Solr server.                       #
#                                                                             #

#                            Which Solr Client To Use
#                            ----- ---- ------ -- ---
# Choose the correct SolrJ client for the Solr installation that you require,
# by default, it is the CloudSolrClient.
#
# NOTE: What the solr.search.server.url will be will depend on the client that
#       you choose.  The SolrJ client __MUST__ be one of
#
#  - Http2SolrClient
#  - HttpJdkSolrClient
#  - LBHttp2SolrClient
#  - CloudSolrClient
#
# By default - we will be using the CloudSolrClient as it works with the
# example instructions for spinning up a test solr instance

#                           Which URLs To Connect To
#                           ----- ---- -- ------- --
# Dependant on which Solr server installation you have, and consequently the
# SolrJ Client that you use, this will either be a single url, or a comma
# separated list of URLs
#
#     solr.search.server.url - the search server URL to connect to which must
#         NOT include the core that it is connecting to - this will be taken
#         care of by the panl request mechanism.
#
#         NOTE that if you are using connector that has multiple URLs, then
#         they MUST be comma separated.
#
#                                ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~ ~

#                      Whether To Enable The Testing URLs
#                      ------- -- ------ --- ------- ----
# The panl results viewer url, this is a simple web app which will allow you to
# test the collections and the URLs that are generated, including field
# inclusion, faceting, querying, and results.
#
# If this property does not exist, or if it is set to false, then no results
# viewer will be available.  You may wish to remove this property for production
# (or perhaps just disallow access to it.)
#
# The URI paths are __ALWAYS__
#     /panl-results-viewer/ - for testing the queries, facets, and results
#     /panl-results-explainer/ - for explaining LPSE encoded URIs and describing
#                               the configuration for the Panl server.

#                     Whether To Enable Verbose Error Messaging
#                     ------- -- ------ ------- ----- ---------
# Whether verbose messaging is turned on for the error (404 / 500) http status
# messages.

#                      Collection Property File Inclusion
#                      ---------- -------- ---- ---------
# Each property file defines a singular collection, with the associated
# properties and configuration.  The format of the property is:
#
#     panl.collection.<collection_name>=<properties_file_location>
#
# Where:
#            <collection_name> is the collection URI path to bind to
#   <properties_file_location> is the relative location __FROM__ this file of
#                              the collection.panl.properties configuration file
